Assignment 2: Multi-User Interaction 

Overview
What I planned to accomplish for this assignment was to have 2 games, one was collaborative
between 1 or more people and one competitive with 2 or more people. As for the collaborative
aspect, my goal was to create a game that would allow players to select 1 color and then the
program would automatically generate the colors selected by the colors and generate a
different color on the screen. As for the competitive game, my goal was to have a sentence on
the screen and the players in the game would have to spell the sentence using buttons and the
first player to type the sentence currently (space included) and with the fastest time wins the
game.

What was Challenging
The most challenging part is being able to create the competitive because there were some
functions that I wanted to implement in the game but wasn’t able to incorporate in the game
due to technical difficulties. For instance, the ability to have the accuracy check when the
players type out the sentence using the buttons wasn’t a 100% working and not functional in
the game. Lastly, trying to get the game to function was difficult and even though I spent
countless hours to try and get the game to work, it just wouldn’t work in the end, which is
pretty difficult to swallow. Overall, I think my scope for the competitive game was too big to
begin with, which is why it ended up not working in the end.

What went Well
The only thing that really went well in this assignment was being able to get my collaborative
game to fully work from what I had envisioned to final end product. I was really pleased with
how it turned out and was glad I was able to implement and produce a color mixer game with
all the functions I wanted.
